# MHToolsBackend

Server for MHToolsFrontend made with node, express, postgres. It was used to better understand how backend APIs are created and consumed, as well as how to implement JWT authentication. It was also used to learn about redis, although currently redis has been commented out of the server, as it wasn't really needed.

Currently deployed on heroku.

Can be run locally using `npm start`
